## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Flutter installed:
- **Flutter SDK**: Version 3.9.0 or higher
- **Dart SDK**: Version 3.9.0 or higher

To check if Flutter is installed:
```bash
flutter --version
```

If not installed, follow the [official Flutter installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SamiShuraim/quick_bite.git
   cd quick_bite
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

That's it! The app will start and connect to our deployed backend automatically.

> **Note**: On first launch, the app may show a loading screen for about 30-60 seconds. This is because our backend runs on free cloud hosting (Render.com) which spins down after inactivity. The app will automatically wait for the server to start and then proceed normally.

### Test Account

When you first open the app, you'll see a test account dialog with pre-filled credentials:
Feel free to use this account or create your own!

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage:

### Run all tests
```bash
flutter test
```

### Run specific test types
```bash
# Unit tests only
flutter test test/unit/

# Widget tests only
flutter test test/widget/

# Integration tests only
flutter test test/integration/
```
